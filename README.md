# Abendgebet

As part of a Creative Technology BSc assignment, I had to build a game based on any painting by iconic Czech painter [Milan Kunc](http://www.milan-kunc.com/) using Processing. I chose the painting Abendgebet (meaning "evening prayer" in German), and made a simple side scroller in about 2 hours.
